    # React + Vite
    # Users and Posts App

    A React application built with Vite that fetches and displays users and their posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId={id}.

    ## Features

    - **User List Page**: Displays a list of users with details (name, email, company, website).
    - **User Posts Page**: Displays posts for a selected user (title and body).
    - **Search Bar**: Allows searching users and posts by title or content.
    - **UI Framework**: Ant Design for styling and components.
    - **State Management**: Redux for handling the search term.

    ## Installation

    ### 1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash

    cd your-repository-name

    This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
